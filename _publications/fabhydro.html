	<p>We introduce FabHydro, a set of fabrication methods to democratize the printing of hydraulic-driven mechanical devices with consumer-grade 3D printers that cost less than 200 US dollars.<br><br>Our core idea centers on low-cost stereolithography (SLA) printers, which can produce both stiff and flexible structures from a selected photosensitive resin in one printing process.<br><br>We first present printer settings and custom support structures to warrant the successful print of flexible and deformable objects.<br><br>We then detail two optional printing processes that seal the hydraulic liquid inside. With the first process, which we called <em>Submerged Printing</em>, the entire hydraulic device, including the mechanical and the fluid inside, can be printed all at once with a slightly modified printer vat. This is suitable for printing hydraulic prototypes for fast design iteration, as the printed device requires no manual assembly and is ready to test out-of-the-printer.<br><br>The second process, which we called <em>Printing with Plugs</em>, allows the user to fill water or other liquids inside the printed chamber and seal them with printed plugs as a post-process. The benefit of this method is that it requires no hardware modification to the printer. However, printed objects require manual assembly.<br><br>Following the printing methods, we report a design space with a range of 3D printable primitives, including the hydraulic generator, transmitter, and actuator. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approaches and the breadth of new designs that they enable, we showcase a set of examples from a printed robotic gripper that can be operated at a distance to a mobile phone stand that serves as a status reminder by repositioning the user’s phone. We conclude with a discussion of our approach’s limitations and possible future improvements.</p>
