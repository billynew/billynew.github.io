<p>
	Every 4 days, a lab member picks a paper that the rest of the group reads and reflects upon. This page serves as a public record of the papers picked in the past. If you're new to technical HCI research, this list may also serve as a good starting point to immerse yourself in the relevant work that appeals to our lab.
