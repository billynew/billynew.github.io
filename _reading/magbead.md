title: 'MagBead: On-Skin Microfluidic Haptic Interface using Tunable Bead'
authors: 'Teng Han , Test , Xiaochen Shi , Yanjun Chen , Baogang Quan , Feng Tian , Hongan Wang , Sriram Subramanian'
venue: 'CHI 2020'
doi: 'https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376190'
reason: 'This is interesting because the paper explores using microfluidics as the driving engine for generating haptic feedback. This helps design an end effector that is small and not loaded with electro mechanical parts.'
